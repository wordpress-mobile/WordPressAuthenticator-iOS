/// - Note: In the future, it would be great if many of the variables and methods
///         could be marked as `optional` to reduce noise when implementing this delegate.
///         The class and the parameter types would need to support `@objc` by inheriting
///         from `NSObject`. That would require significant changes to Authenticator's
///         types and to the Host Apps, which is why it hasn't been implemented yet.
